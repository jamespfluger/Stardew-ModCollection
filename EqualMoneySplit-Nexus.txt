Equally splits money earned from selling crops and items between all online players


















[size=6]Equal Money Split[/size]

[size=3]The goal of this mod is to help the logistics of each player manage their own money without having to worry about how their spending affects the group. Money earned through selling crops and items is automatically distributed equally between each player (see specifics in the how to use section).[/size]
